Angler
======

This is my first project in Objective-C and Cocoa on OSX.

It was mentioned to win a stupid TV game. The busty girl was waving the money, requesting people guess, how many 4-angles are on the picture.

This app is a tool which allows you to draw the shape and found all then-angles.

Unfortunately, the TV show was terminated before I finished the app.


The messy code
==============

I have to sorry for the code. I learned Cocoa and Obj-C on it. So, the design and code quality was secondary.

I attempted to wrap some Obj-C constructions (which I don't like) by my favorite C++ generics. It has shown it wasn't a good idea. 

However, the application itself is 100% functional with no known bugs.
